## Watchlist - React

http://a5-alppiskin.glitch.me

When I started this project at A3, I was initially trying to create a list app with data persistence using the entire MERN stack but I did not know React so I settled for EJS at the time. Now, we learned React and what I needed for this project was to use React components as modules instead of using create-react-app. I managed to insert two components and called small images/GIFs from those components.
